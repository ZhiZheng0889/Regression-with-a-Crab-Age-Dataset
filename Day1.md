# **Portfolio Report: Data Analytics**

## Introduction

This portfolio report provides an overview of the data analytics conducted on two datasets, namely `train_data` and `orig_data`. The analysis includes a description of the datasets, summary statistics, and an exploration of potential insights. While specific data analytic plots are not mentioned in the provided code, the report focuses on the information presented and suggests further steps for analysis.

## 1. Dataset Description

The `train_data` dataset consists of various columns, including `id`, `Sex`, `Length`, `Diameter`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Shucked Weight`, `Viscera Weight`, `Shell Weight`, and `Age`. The initial rows of the `train_data` dataset are displayed, giving a glimpse of the data structure and values.

The `orig_data` dataset contains the same columns as `train_data` and is also presented with the first few rows. A comparison of these datasets can provide insights into their similarities and differences.

## 2. Summary Statistics

Summary statistics for both datasets are provided. For the `train_data` dataset, the summary statistics offer valuable information such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values for numerical columns. The columns included are `id`, `Length`, `Diameter`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Shucked Weight`, `Viscera Weight`, `Shell Weight`, and `Age`.

Similarly, the `orig_data` dataset is analyzed using summary statistics. The same columns as in `train_data` are included, providing descriptive insights into the dataset's numerical variables.

## 3. Data Analytics and Next Steps

Although the provided code and output do not contain specific data analytic plots, further analysis and exploration can be conducted to gain deeper insights from the datasets. Here are a few suggested next steps:

-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the datasets using various plots, such as scatter plots, bar charts, or line graphs. Explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and detect potential outliers.
    
-   Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients between variables to determine the strength and direction of relationships. Identify significant correlations that may impact the analysis.
    
-   Hypothesis Testing: Formulate hypotheses related to the data and perform statistical tests to validate or reject them. This can involve techniques like t-tests, ANOVA, or chi-square tests, depending on the nature of the variables.
    
-   Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models, such as regression or classification models, to forecast or classify outcomes based on the available features. Evaluate the model's performance and assess its applicability to the dataset.
